Title: Bayesian Estimation of Incoherent Neutron scattering Backgrounds
Description: Neutron diffraction yields detailed information about atomic
    structure (essentially, the question "what are the atoms and how are they
    arranged?").  This information is carried by *coherent* scattering.
    Unfortunately, hydrogen-containing materials also contain a very strong
    *in*coherent signal as well.  The goal of this package is to estimate this
    incoherent signal, so we can analyze what's left and figure out where the
    atoms are.
